			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Lathesh shetty, and I am a Game Designer with experience in VR development and passion for Multiplayer FPS. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with a variety of clients and organizations, helping them achieve their goals and bring their visions to life.

				On this site, you will find a collection of my work, ranging from design projects to marketing campaigns and everything in between. Each piece represents a unique challenge and an opportunity to flex my creative muscles, and I am excited to share them with you.
				
				Whether you are a potential employer, collaborator, or simply someone interested in my work, I hope that this portfolio gives you a sense of my skills, experience, and style. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
